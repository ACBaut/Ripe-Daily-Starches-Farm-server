# Ripe-Daily-Starches-Farm-server

This was a fake farm created to present our knowledge designing and creating a database system that was learned during my CS442 Database 
System 2022 semester. The purpose of this farm was to showcase a few different database tables using different restraits that work together in allowing things
such as:
- Adding employee's and showing their position/pay/person info
- Allowing a "customer" to login using a provided username/password that displays past order history and allow them to place another order to their store
- An administrator's page that shows the current inventory in the Silo's on the farm
- An overall page that displays all of the above in some tables

The technologies used in this project are as follows:

- Amazon AWS Services
  - EC2 to have remote access to page
  - RDS that remotely ran the main database this project ran on
- Apache HTTP Server
- MariaDB as my relation database choice

and languages used:

- HTML
- CSS
- PHP

Before this, I had no experience working using front-end languages such as HTML/CSS or directly speaking with a backend using PHP. This was also
my first time using any AWS services as a remote server and learning how to set it up and commuicate with it had some growing pains, but I came out 
enjoying the experience of learning everything involved!

Things needed to be improved on:
- Better organization of my HTML/CSS stylings, learning on the fly lead to some sloppy placing and repeated code that could have been fixed up
- Learning and cleaning the syntax and implementation of PHP better, although it was very similar to Javascript, in my opinion, I found it very confusing 
on how and when to include PHP segments and add HTML such as adding information to tables, such as in EmployeeData.php
